# Python for QA – Interview Preparation

## Q1. What is Python, and why is it commonly used in test automation?

### Interview-Ready Answer

Python is a high-level, open-source programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is platform-independent and runs on multiple operating systems.

Python is widely used in test automation because it has a clean syntax, strong community support, and powerful testing libraries like pytest and Playwright. It enables testers to write maintainable automation scripts and easily integrate them with CI/CD pipelines.

## Q2. What are the different data types in Python?

### Interview-Ready Answer

In Python, data types define the type of value a variable can store. Python provides several built-in data types.

Common data types include:
- **Numeric:** `int`, `float`
- **Sequence:** `list`, `tuple`
- **Mapping:** `dict`
- **Set:** `set`

For example, an integer stores whole numbers, a list stores multiple ordered values, a tuple is similar to a list but immutable, a dictionary stores data in key-value pairs, and a set stores unique values. All data types in Python are implemented as classes.

## Q3. What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?

### Interview-Ready Answer

The main difference between a list and a tuple in Python is mutability. A list is mutable, meaning its elements can be modified, added, or removed after creation. A tuple is immutable and cannot be changed once it is created.

Lists are represented using square brackets `[]`, while tuples use parentheses `()`.

Lists are used when data needs to be updated frequently, whereas tuples are preferred for fixed data such as configuration values or constant test data.

## Q4. What are conditional statements in Python?

### Interview-Ready Answer

**What is it?**  
Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in a program by evaluating conditions.

**What is the use?**  
They control the flow of execution using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.

**Why is it used?**  
They allow automation scripts to handle different scenarios such as validations, decision-making, and error handling based on test conditions.
