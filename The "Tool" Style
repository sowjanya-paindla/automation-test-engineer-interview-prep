When I use dir() and see many built-in methods (like strip, upper, lower),
is there a way in Python to check:
The syntax of that method
The parameters it accepts

It is a classic Python "rite of passage" to use dir() and realize you've just opened a digital junk drawer. While dir() tells you what is there, it’s notoriously tight-lipped about how to use it.
To get the syntax and parameters, you have a few built-in "inspectors" at your disposal.

1. The help() Function (The Gold Standard)
This is the most direct way to get a readable summary of a method, including its signature and a brief description.

How to use it: Pass the method itself (without parentheses) into help().

Example:

Python
help(str.strip)
What you'll see: strip(self, chars=None, /)
It will then explain that it returns a copy of the string with leading and trailing characters removed.

2. The __doc__ Attribute
Every well-behaved Python method has a "docstring." You can access this string directly if you want a quick, raw look at the documentation without the formatted help() interface.

Example:

Python
print(str.upper.__doc__)
3. The inspect Module (For the Pros)
If you are writing code that needs to programmatically figure out what parameters a method takes (rather than just reading it yourself), use the inspect module.

How to use it:

Python
import inspect
sig = inspect.signature(str.replace)
print(sig) 
# Output: (self, old, new, count=-1, /)
