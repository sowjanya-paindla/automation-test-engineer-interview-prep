## Q2. When should we NOT use Automation Testing?

**Answer:**

Automation testing should not be used in the following situations:

- When requirements or UI change frequently  
- For one-time or short-term test cases  
- When the project duration is very short  
- For usability or exploratory testing that requires human judgment  
- For scenarios involving dynamic elements like OTP or CAPTCHA  

Automation works best for stable and repetitive scenarios. If the feature is unstable, automation maintenance cost becomes high.

## Q3. What types of test cases are good candidates for Automation?

**Answer:**
Test cases that are repetitive and executed frequently, such as regression and smoke test cases, are good candidates for automation. 

Stable features with well-defined requirements and high-risk or critical business scenarios are also suitable for automation.

Automation is especially useful for test cases that require large data sets or need to be executed across multiple browsers and environments.

The following test cases are ideal for automation:

- Regression test cases  
- Smoke and sanity test cases  
- Repetitive and time-consuming test cases  
- High-risk or critical business scenarios  
- Data-driven test cases  
- Cross-browser and cross-environment testing  

Automation is most effective for stable, repeatable, and frequently executed test cases.
