## Question 1: Can you walk me through your experience and key projects?

### Interview-Ready Answer

I have around 2 years of experience working as an Automation Test Engineer. I primarily worked on an enterprise Electronic Toll Collection platform called QBOS.

My role involved designing and executing automated test scripts using Python with Playwright and pytest. I was part of the team responsible for building and maintaining the automation framework, following a modular and keyword-driven approach.

In addition to UI automation, I executed API test cases using pytest to validate request and response data. I also performed database validations using MongoDB to ensure data consistency between the UI, APIs, and backend systems.

I was involved in accessibility testing to ensure the application met accessibility standards. I worked closely with developers in an Agile environment to identify defects early and improve overall software quality.
